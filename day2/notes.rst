Notes from day2
***************

We should have made more time to go through the exercises from the previous
day.

Need better background on reading values from file, maybe revise this.

List comprehension maybe not needed in introduction.

Notebooks should be numbered to make it obvious the order in which they should
be done.

It seemed to work well having an easy, intermediate and hard exercise.
