The data in ``camera.txt`` comes from reading the file ``camera.png`` in the
scikit-image ``data`` directory, and writing the read values out to a text
file.  I could not find a copyright statement or license for it, but many
image-processing packages use it, and it appears to be in the public domain.

The data from the anatomical image stored in ``anatomical.txt`` is from the
OpenFMRI project, dataset ``ds114``: https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000114 . It
is version of ``sub009/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz`` from which I (MB) have
loaded the data and written the data to a text file.  The dataset is covered by
a Public Domain Dedication and License version 1.0 :

The data for the anatomical image `ds107_sub001_highres.nii` is an uncompressed
copy of ``sub001/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz`` from OpenFMRI dataset ``ds107``
https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000107, also covered under the PDDL 1.0 license.
