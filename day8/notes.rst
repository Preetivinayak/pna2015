Note from day8
##############

One of the students found that it was difficult to remember the PCA stuff from
the previous week.

I had a feeling that it is hard to get the relationship of the 2D axes in the
pca introduction (last week), and the 173 D axes in the FMRI image.

None of the students go onto the slice timing notebook.

There was an error in the pca_solutions notebook, discussed in
``dots_demeaned.ipynb``.  The error fixed in this commit.
