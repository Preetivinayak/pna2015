This is the future branch of the practical neuroimaging materials

It is for:

* cleanups from the 2015 materials, that we do not want to put into the
  students' repository, to avoid confusion or merge conflicts;
* the instructors impressions of how the materials worked, and what could be
  improved for next time.   These generally go in a ``notes.rst`` file in the
  directory for the day.
