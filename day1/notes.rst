Notes from day1 class
*********************

On day2 it became clear that some of the students had not got to the
end of the exercises, and did not know the idions for reading files.

Maybe more on::

    my_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']
    for value in my_list:
        print(value)

This also being useful for iterating through files with ``readlines()`` for
example.

Python 3 compatible prints.

Need to cover the ``%03d`` syntax.

Maybe switch to ``{:03d}'.format(3)`` syntax rather than ``%`` formating.
