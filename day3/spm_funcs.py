This will be your new module defining SPM-like functions

Here you want the get_spm_globals function from the earlier exercise, with
anything imports and other definitions that this function needs.

When you are done, you should be able to run the test_spm_funcs.py script and
see two very similar values printed to the terminal (see the script for what
these values are).  You run the script like this:

    python test_spm_funcs.py
