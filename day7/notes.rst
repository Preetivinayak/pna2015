Notes from day 7

Far too much material for the class.

We didn't get to the exercises at all.

The homework was probably at the right level.

Next time - maybe we can:

* cover projection as part of a previous discussion of correlated regressors
  (including the homework on projection);
* cover reshaping, broadcasting in a previous discussion of modelling (reshape
  4D data to 2D, do stats, project back;

For the exercises, students need explanation of plotting lines with two
points:

* to plot a line between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) use ``plot([x1, x2], [y1,
  y2])``.

Need some discussion of what an ND axis == component means.  Something on the
line of 'the component is a characteristic time course that features in a
large number of voxels; the component coefficient is an expression of the
amplitude of the component in each voxel'.  The idea of using PCA to detect
unsuspected sources of variation.

Might want some text on how PCA axis removes correlation between variables.

Consider calling 'variables' 'features'.
