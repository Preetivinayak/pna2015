Notes from the day0 class
*************************

The installation script should check minimum versions, particularly of
the notebook.  It should also check that the user has pip and that the
pip the user has corresponds to their Python.

I should ask everyone to send me the diagnostic output so I can can
understand the range of machines and installs.

scikit-image should be in the base install.

The talk was too long, so I had to generate the answers in the
notebook rather than letting the students try this.

Might need more background on hexadecimal to explain the value 0x10
that shows up in the notebook text.
